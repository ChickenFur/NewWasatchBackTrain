A significant step forward has been proposed for the Wasatch Back Train Line project with a new bill draft that would authorize a comprehensive feasibility study and potential implementation of the train line connecting Provo to Salt Lake City via Heber and Park City.

## Key Components of the Proposed Bill

### Feasibility Study
The bill authorizes the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) to conduct an 18-month feasibility study that would examine:

- Route and alignment options with environmental and community impact assessments
- Potential ridership and revenue projections
- Comprehensive cost-benefit analysis
- Economic benefits and job creation potential

### Implementation Plan
If the feasibility study demonstrates viability, UDOT would be authorized to:

- Develop a detailed project schedule
- Create a comprehensive budget for construction and operation
- Plan for necessary right-of-way acquisitions
- Provide regular updates to the Legislature

### Funding Mechanism
The proposed legislation includes:

- Utilization of state transportation funds
- Potential for additional legislative appropriations as needed
- Flexibility for securing various funding sources

## Next Steps

This bill represents a crucial first step toward making the Wasatch Back Train Line a reality. However, it's important to note that the proposal will need to undergo:

1. Legal review
2. Public hearings
3. Transportation expert input
4. State legislative process
