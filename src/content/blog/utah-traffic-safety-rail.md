We all know the frustration of traffic here in Utah. Whether we are stuck on I-80 or I-15 idling our cars adding to the smog that increases rates of dementia, stroke and heart disease, losing time and money.

Utah stands at a crossroads in its transportation future. With around 300 traffic fatalities annually on Utah roads and thousands more injured, we must seriously consider safer alternatives. The economic cost of these tragedies, combined with the estimated $1,000 per year each Utah driver loses to traffic congestion, presents a compelling case for change.

Having witnessed the efficiency of high-speed rail networks in Japan and Europe, the contrast with Utah's current transportation infrastructure is stark. A single high-speed rail line can move up to 12,000 passengers per hour – equivalent to a ten-lane highway operating at peak efficiency. Imagine boarding a train at Salt Lake International Airport, reaching downtown's historic Rio Grande station in minutes, then gliding up through Parleys Canyon to Park City, continuing down to Heber, and terminating at Provo Airport. This Wasatch Back corridor could revolutionize how we move through our state.

The numbers tell a clear story: Japan's Shinkansen has transported billions of passengers without a single fatality since its inception in 1964. Meanwhile, Utah's mountain highways face treacherous winter conditions and frequent accidents, particularly along Parleys Canyon where emergency responses are often delayed by traffic congestion. Each hour of highway delay costs our economy approximately $24 per commuter in lost productivity.

The benefits would be transformative. We could avoid the environmentally destructive widening of I-80 and Highway 40. Our air quality would improve as we reduce vehicle emissions. Tourism would flourish with convenient airport-to-resort connections. Most importantly, we'd preserve Utah's natural beauty by choosing rails over endless pavement.

The time has come for Park City, neighboring communities, and state leadership to make this vital investment in Utah's future. We've seen this model succeed globally – let's bring this innovation home. Our children deserve a safer, cleaner, more efficient, and more connected Utah.

I've spoken to my state representative Mike Kohler, who is on board with moving this forward. Please contact your city council, county council and state representatives. Let's move this forward. There are billions of dollars in federal money waiting for states to apply to create mass transit just like this.

Utah's population is going to double by 2050 or 2060. Instead of doubling the number of roads and the amount of Utah that ends up paved over, let's embrace and create a better future with proven and safe technology.

Sincerely,  
Christen Thompson
